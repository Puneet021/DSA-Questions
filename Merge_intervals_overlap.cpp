// Consider a big party where N guests came to it and a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times was maintained.
// Find the minimum time at which there were maximum guests at the party. Note that entries in the register are not
// in any order.

// Example 1:

// Input:
// N = 5
// Entry= {1, 2,10, 5, 5}
// Exit = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
// Output: 3 5
// Explanation: At time 5 there were
//              guest number 2, 4 and 5 present.
// Example 2:

// Input:
// N = 7
// Entry= {13, 28, 29, 14, 40, 17, 3}
// Exit = {107, 95, 111, 105, 70, 127, 74}
// Output: 7 40
// Explanation: At time 40 there were
//              all 7 guests present in the party.
// Your Task:
// You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaxGuests() which takes 3 arguments(Entry array, Exit array, N) and returns the maximum number of guests present at a particular time and that time as a pair.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(N*Log(N) ).
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

// Constraints:
// 1 <= N <= 105
// 1 <= Entry[i],Exit[i] <= 105
